##PrivEsc Checklists

##Kernel Exploits
Whenever we encounter a server running an old operating system, we should start by looking for potential kernel vulnerabilities that may exist

##Vulnerable Software
Another thing we should look for is installed software. For example, we can use the dpkg -l command on Linux or look at C:\Program Files

##User Privileges
Another critical aspect to look for after gaining access to a server is the privileges available to the user we have access to
Sudo
SUID
Windows Token Privileges
The sudo command in Linux allows a user to execute commands as a different user. It is usually used to allow lower privileged users to execute commands as root without giving them access to the root user. 
This is generally done as specific commands can only be run as root 'like tcpdump' or allow the user to access certain root-only directories. We can check what sudo privileges we have with the sudo -l command:

##Scheduled Tasks
Add new scheduled tasks/cron jobs
Trick them to execute a malicious software
The easiest way is to check if we are allowed to add new scheduled tasks. In Linux, a common form of maintaining scheduled tasks is through Cron Jobs.
/etc/crontab
/etc/cron.d
/var/spool/cron/crontabs/root

##Exposed Credentials
Next, we can look for files we can read and see if they contain any exposed credentials. 
This is very common with configuration files, log files, and user history files (bash_history in Linux and PSReadLine in Windows).
